### Progress notes:
- Day 1
As an initial exercise, Maya and Felipe explored some Saildrone data (hydrography) and SSH from altimeters in the Southern Ocean between the beginning of 2019 and Sep 2019. We got stuck trying to figure out how to upload CMENS data with xr.open_dataset(). We are trying to add the user info (username and password) into the code.
